# hi.js - HTML includes

**hi.js** - (h)tml (i)ncludes, is a little snippet of JavaScript that uses HTML `imports` ([w3c spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-imports/)) 
to provide an *include* functionality in HTML. Basically, you will be able to include and reuse HTML documents in other HTML documents.
